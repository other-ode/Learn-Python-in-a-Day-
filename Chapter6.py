# Chapter 6: Making Choices and Decisions

'''
if statement, for loop and while
loop. These are known as control flow tools; they control the flow of the
program. In addition, weâ€™ll also look at the try, except statement that
determines what the program should do when an error occurs

The most common condition statement is the comparison statement. If
we want to compare whether two variables are the same, we use the ==
sign (double =). For instance, if you write x == y, you are asking the
program to check if the value of x is equals to the value of y. If they are
equal, the condition is met and the statement will evaluate to True. Else,
the statement will evaluate to False.

Other comparison signs include != (not equals), < (smaller than), >
(greater than), <= (smaller than or equals to) and >= (greater than or
equals to). The list below shows how these signs can be used and gives
examples of statements that will evaluate to True.

# Equals - ==
print(5==2)

# Not equals - !=
print (5!=2)

# Greater than - >
print (5>2)

# Smaller/lesser than - <
print (5<2)

# Greater than or equals to: 5>=2
print (5>=2)

# Smaller than or equals to: 2 <= 5
print (5<=2)

# 3 logical operators - and, or, not
print(5==5 and 2>1) # True

print (5 > 2 or 7 > 10 or 3 == 2) # True

print (not 2>5) # True
